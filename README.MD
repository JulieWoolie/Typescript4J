# Typescript4j
Typescript compiler for compiling Typescript programs to JVM bytecode, written in Java.

## Progress
This project is close from finished, and probably won't be finished any time
soon due to my lack of ability to focus on a single project for a long time
  
At present, this project has a half-finished parser and no code optimizer or
compiler to speak of.

## Goals
1. [x] Lexer
2. [ ] Parser
3. [ ] Code optimizer
4. [ ] Bytecode compiler
5. [ ] Embeddable Scripting engine API
6. [ ] `javax.script.ScriptEngine` implementation
